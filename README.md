fix_resources.py
===========

Introduction
------------
"fix_resources.py" was created to help resolve resource identifiers in disassembled Android application files (smali files).  For more information on this topic, check out my blog: http://blog.thecobraden.com/2013/04/fixing-resource-identifiers-in.html.

Requirements
----------
"fix_resources.py" requires python and the lxml module (http://lxml.de).  The code was written and tested on Linux but should have no issues running on Windows/Mac platforms.
